####Week 2 Statistical Linear Regression MOdels

##Least squares is an estimation tool
##Consider developing a probabilistic model for linear regression

##      Yi=b0+b1*Xi+Ei
##      E are assumed iid N(0,sigmal^2)
##      Error term -- maybe considered as missing variables in model

##Note
##E[Yi|Xi=xi]=mui=b0+b1*xi
##Var(Yi|Xi=xi)=sigma^2
